# But, how the TC39 works?
Meetings every two months 📆<br />
Proposals go through a process based on stages 🚵‍♂️

---
# 💡 Stage 0: Strawman
Just an idea, not a formal proposal. You could even write one!<br />
Very highly likely it will change or be dropped.
---
# 🤔 Stage 1: Proposal
TC39 is willing to examine, discuss and contribute to the proposal. <br />
WIP, much could change or even dropped.
---
# 📝 Stage 2: Draft
Firt version of what will be in the specification.<br />
Changes could occur.
---
# 👩🏽‍💼 Stage 3: Candidate
Spec is completed but needs feedback from browser implementations and users.<br />
Changes are unlikely but could happen.
---
# 🤩 Stage 4: Finished
It will be included to the next yearly standard ratification.
---
# Lots of proposals on different stages
